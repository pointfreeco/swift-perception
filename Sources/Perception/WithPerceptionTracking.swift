/// Observes changes to perceptible models.

/// Use this view to automatically subscribe to the changes of any fields in ``Perceptible()``
/// models used in the view. Typically you will install this view at the root of your view like
/// so:
///
/// ```swift
/// struct FeatureView: View {
///   let model: FeatureModel
///
///   var body: some View {
///     WithPerceptionTracking {
///       // ...
///     }
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// You will also need to use ``WithPerceptionTracking`` in any escaping, trailing closures used in
/// SwiftUI's various navigation APIs, such as the sheet modifier:
///
/// ```swift
/// .sheet(isPresented: $isPresented) {
///   WithPerceptionTracking {
///     // Access to `model` in here will be properly observed.
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// If a field of a `@Perceptible` model is accessed in a view while _not_ inside
/// ``WithPerceptionTracking``, then a runtime warning will helpfully be triggered:
///
/// > ðŸŸ£ Runtime Warning: Perceptible state was accessed but is not being tracked. Track changes to
/// > state by wrapping your view in a 'WithPerceptionTracking' view.
///
/// To debug this, expand the warning in the Issue Navigator of Xcode (cmd+5), and click through the
/// stack frames displayed to find the line in your view where you are accessing state without being
/// inside ``WithPerceptionTracking``.
